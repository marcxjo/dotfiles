# dotfiles

Config files for a setup based primarily on bspwm, lemonbar, dunst, and stupidterm.

One of the highlights of this repo is a collection of scripts that allows the user to create and switch color themes for the main applications. Ini file creation is automated for the apps that rely on them.

A few starter color schemes are included. Most of the files are {minorly ,un-}modified colorshemes generated by the shell script/recently obsoleted version of wal. Note that this version of wal tends to generate far more colors than the Python version, at least in its default configuration.

# TODO

* Links to wallpapers that match included color schemes for a nice theme starter.

* Easy automation of switching themes non-destructively (i.e., without just needlessly re-writing existing copies of files.)

# About directories

Config files are placed in the usual xdg directory.

Themes are placed under ~/.local/share to match the conventions of system-level themes for frameworks like GTK+. This does not accord with the convention of ~/.themes for home themes in order to keep X11 theme elements from creating directories which conflict with GTK+ or other themes.

Scripts are roughly placed into two categories. Scripts under ~/bin represent simple, specialized helper programs which don't necessarily affect the desktop experience directly.

Scripts under ~/.local/bin affect the user experience directly, most often in terms of aesthetics or productivity. This is why the wal post script is under ~/bin but the themer scripts which use it are under ~/.local/bin.
