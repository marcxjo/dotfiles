# dotfiles

Config files for a setup based primarily on bspwm, lemonbar, dunst, and stupidterm.

One of the highlights of this repo is a collection of scripts that allows the user to create and switch color themes for the main applications. Ini file creation is automated for the apps that rely on them.

A few starter color schemes are included. Most of the files are {minorly ,un-}modified colorshemes generated by the shell script/recently obsoleted version of wal. Note that this version of wal tends to generate far more colors than the Python version, at least in its default configuration.

# TODO

* Links to wallpapers that match included color schemes for a nice theme starter.

* Easy automation of switching themes non-destructively (i.e., without just needlessly re-writing existing copies of files.)
