# dotfiles

Config files for a setup based primarily on bspwm, lemonbar, and stupidterm.

In order to make the startup scripts work for the wm and panel, you first need to do the following:

* Find a colorscheme under .cache/wal that you like (or have created yourself), and run wal over the scheme file;

* Create the variables $colorbg and $colorfg in the corresponding shell script (either by adding new colors or referencing values from e.g. $color0 and $color15);

* Point the symlinks bspwm-color.sh and bspwm-colors.xresources the shell script and Xresources file for the desired color scheme. The symlinks should be in the same directory as the files themselves.

A few starter color schemes are included. Most of the files are minorly modified colorshemes generated by the shell script/recently obsoleted version of wal. Note that this version of wal tends to generate far more colors than the Python version, at least in its default configuration.

# TODO

* Links to wallpapers that match included color schemes for a nice theme starter.

* Include a script to automate theme creation for stupidterm based on the current theme.

* Modify all desktop scripts to work with any >=16-color palette.
